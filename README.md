This informative text aims to provide brief information about the package. Therefore, it is written in a very short and detailed way. However, a developer who reads this information will be able to start using the package easily. Please [visit](https://github.com/Sci-Hook/scicon/wiki) the official Scicon documentation for more detailed information.

# General Information

Icons are a good choice to make your projects better from a design and visual point of view. Scicon Icon Pack is an icon pack that you can freely use in your work. If you wish, you can include all Scicon icons in your project by installing this package directly, or you can install the other categories of the Scicon Icon Package separately and include the icons in the icon category you want in your project.

# Installation and Usage

There are two recommended ways to use the icon package: include it via CDN and install it via npm. Below we describe how you can use these two methods:

## Include via CDN ![CDN Support](https://img.shields.io/badge/CDN%20Support-Active-green?style=flat)

To use the package via CDN, you need to use jsDelivr. You can use the CDN link below:

`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sci-hook/scicon@latest/style.css`

You can use the code below to include the package directly in your project:

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sci-hook/scicon@latest/style.css">`

You can add the above code to the `<head>` tag of the file where you will use the icon pack.

## Include via npm ![npm Support](https://img.shields.io/badge/npm%20Support-Active-green?style=flat)

To install the package via npm, run the following code in the terminal:

`$ npm i scicon`

Then you can add it to your SCSS file as follows:

`@import 'node_modules/scicon';`

# Versioning

When versioning the Scicon Icon Pack, we combine Semantic Versioning with our own versioning system. Here's how we version the icons:

`<main-version (major)>.<icon-update (minor)>.patch>`

The major version is the top version of the package and includes major changes. These major changes include major updates such as software changes and new icon styles. We recommend that you always keep the major version of Scicon Pack up to date.

Minor version includes newly added, updated and removed icons. For example; this version increases when the icon is changed, added or removed.

Patches include software bug fixes, typos, document updates and minor icon fixes. Patches do not cover major changes. However, using the stable version of the package is still important to get the most out of the package.
